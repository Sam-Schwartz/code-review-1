    <p>I'm taking an introductory programming class at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> in order to learn foundational programming skills and concepts.</p>
    <p>Our entire curriculum is <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming-evening">detailed online,</a> but briefly, I'm learning to write in</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML and CSS: The presentation and styling languages of the web, and
        <li>JavaScript: The programming language of the web.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I'm learning to augment the impact of basic CSS and JavaScript with</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap: A framework for easily creating good-looking websites, and</li>
        <li>jQuery: A JavaScript library for making interactive web pages.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I'm also learning about how to initiate, track, and document my project work by using
      <ul>
        <li>Command Line: The tool programmers use to interact with their computers,</li>
        <li>Git: A tool programmers use to track their code, and</li>
        <li>Markdown: A simple language for documents.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Epicodus follows a pair-programming model. In each class, we work through a daily lesson with a partner to understand and practice new material. Then we create a project to showcase our newly aquired programming skills. By working in pairs, we hone the ability to speak clearly about programming concepts, identify points of confusion, and articulate problem-solving strategies. Our project work reinforces conceptual learning by requiring immediate application of new material. It's a great model, and I'm learning a lot!</p>
